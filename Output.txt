[1][2][3] For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations.
Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life.
[1][2][3] Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.
Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization.
[7][8][9] Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.
Life on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,[10] is immensely diverse.
These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.
